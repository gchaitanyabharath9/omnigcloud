## Reporting a Vulnerability

As an **EB-1A Scholarly Initiative**, we take the integrity of the G-Framework seriously. We are committed to protecting the digital sovereignty of our users.

If you discover a security vulnerability within the G-Framework or the OmniGCloud platform, please report it immediately:

1. **Do not open a public Issue.**
2. Email your discovery to `security@omnigcloud.com`.
3. Provide a detailed summary, including steps to reproduce and a proof-of-concept (PoC) if applicable.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for remediation.

## Our Security Architecture

The platform architecture implements the **Sovereign Security Mesh (SSM)**, including:
- **Zero-Trust Logic**: Mandatory verification for all cross-cloud intents.
- **Deceptive Ingestion**: Intelligent shielding against prompt injection and model abuse.
- **Atomic State Sovereignty**: Cryptographically signed infrastructure manifests.

Thank you for helping us maintain the world's most resilient multi-cloud control plane.
