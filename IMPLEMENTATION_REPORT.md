# Sitemap & SEO Sanitation Report

## Objective
Fix the sitemap and robots.txt implementation in the Next.js App Router project to eliminate 404s, ensure canonical consistency, and centralize route management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized Route Management
- **`src/config/routes.ts`**: Established as the single source of truth defining `PUBLIC_ROUTES_MANIFEST` (for sitemap) and `PRIVATE_ROUTES` (for robots.txt).
- **`src/navigation.ts`**: Centralized the `locales` array, which is now imported by `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`, and `request.ts`.

### 2. Physical Route Validation
- **`scripts/validate_routes.ts`**: Implemented a CI guard script that performs static analysis on the filesystem.
- It verifies that every route listed in the `PUBLIC_ROUTES_MANIFEST` has a corresponding `page.tsx` file in `src/app/[locale]/...`.
- Total confirmed public routes: **46**.
- Total sitemap entries: **368** (46 routes × 8 locales).

### 3. Sitemap & Robots.txt Enhancements
- **Canonical Consistency**: All URLs use `config.site.url` as the base, synchronized with `metadataBase`.
- **Sitemap Stability**: `lastModified` is now set to the 1st of the current month to prevent search engine churn.
- **Bot Protection**: Robots.txt now strictly blocks AI crawlers and protects private routes across all locales.

### 4. CI/CD Integration
- Added `npm run validate:routes`.
- Integrated validation into `npm run gate` and `npm run build`.
- Verified that `npm run seo:gate` passes with 0 violations.

## Verified Routes (46 total)
The following paths were verified against the filesystem:
- **Core**: `/`, `/pricing`, `/products`, `/solutions`, `/company`, `/contact`
- **Docs**: `/docs`, `/docs/whitepaper`
- **Research**: `/research`, `/research/papers`, `/research/papers/a1-a6`, `/research/papers/aecp`, `/research/papers/scholarly-article`
- **Services**: `/services` + 8 specialized sub-services
- **Industries**: `/industries` + 2 sub-industries (Finance, Healthcare)
- **Resources**: `/blog`, `/case-studies`, `/onboarding`, `/demo`, `/visual-library`, `/community`, `/founder`, `/partners`, `/publications`
- **Legal**: `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/security`, `/compliance`

## Quality Gate Results
- **Filesystem Route Validation**: ✅ PASSED
- **i18n Key Coverage**: ✅ PASSED
- **SEO Crawl Test**: ✅ PASSED (0 violations)
- **Hardcoded String Gate**: ✅ PASSED
- **Typecheck & Build**: ✅ PASSED
