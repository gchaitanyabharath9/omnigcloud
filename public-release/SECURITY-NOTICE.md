# Security Notice

## Research Posture
This repository contains technical research papers and architectural frameworks concerning distributed systems and cloud governance. The contents are intended for scholarly dissemination and documentation of technical methodologies.

## Responsible Disclosure
If you identify a potential security vulnerability in any of the architectural patterns or code samples provided in this repository, please report it through the following process:
1. **Private Reporting**: Send a detailed report to `research@example.com`.
2. **Analysis**: We will review the report and coordinate a response.
3. **Public Disclosure**: We follow a 90-day disclosure timeline for confirmed vulnerabilities.

## Limitations of Scope
- **Not Production Code**: The code samples in this repository are for demonstration and architectural validation purposes. They are not intended for direct production use without independent security audit and hardening.
- **Architectural Reference**: The frameworks provided (AECP, etc.) are architectural reference models. Implementation of these models in a specific environment requires careful consideration of local security requirements and threat models.

## Security Controls
We employ the following controls for this research:
- **Sanitized Outputs**: All production metrics and identifiers have been anonymized or generalized for public release.
- **Threat Modeling**: Tactical exploitation details have been converted into defensive threat models and mitigations.
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: All policy-as-code samples emphasize cryptographic verification and non-repudiation.
