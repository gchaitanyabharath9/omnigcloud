# Universal Scholarly Submission Checklist

This checklist ensures that all technical papers and frameworks in this repository meet the rigorous standards required for publication in IEEE, ACM, and arXiv.

## 1. Structural Compliance
- [ ] **Abstract**: Clear, concise, and avoids promotional language.
- [ ] **Keywords**: 5-10 standardized technical terms.
- [ ] **Introduction**: Contextualizes the work within the field.
- [ ] **Problem Statement**: Explicitly defines the technical gap being addressed.
- [ ] **Related Work**: Positions the work against academic and industrial state-of-the-art.
- [ ] **Methodology**: Detailed explanation of the approach/architecture.
- [ ] **Original Contributions**: 3-6 bulleted points detailing unique value.
- [ ] **Evaluation/Results**: Quantified evidence from production or benchmarks.
- [ ] **Limitations**: Explicit acknowledgment of constraints and threats to validity.
- [ ] **References**: Correctly formatted in IEEE-style citations.

## 2. Claim & Tone Sanitization
- [ ] **Claim Bounding**: Statements such as "it is always fast" replaced with "observed latency under evaluated conditions."
- [ ] **Neutral Tone**: Removed "revolutionary," "unprecedented," and similar marketing adjectives.
- [ ] **Metric Scoping**: All metrics (e.g., 99.99%) are tied to a specific evaluation period or environment.

## 3. IP & Privacy Safety (arXiv/Public Release)
- [ ] **Sensitive Terms**: Zero occurrences of sensitive repository names (e.g., omnigcloud).
- [ ] **Personal Data**: Removed email addresses, phone numbers, and location details of researchers (unless explicitly desired in final draft).
- [ ] **Security Sanitization**: Internal URLs, IPs, and exploitation details converted to generic threat models.
- [ ] **Journal Posture**: No mention of "Evidence," "Petition," or specific immigration categories.

## 4. Formatting & Technical
- [ ] **Mermaid Syntax**: All diagrams verified for rendering correctness.
- [ ] **Math Expressions**: LaTeX symbols (e.g., $\alpha$, $\beta$) used for technical constants.
- [ ] **Citation Sync**: References in text match the References section.
