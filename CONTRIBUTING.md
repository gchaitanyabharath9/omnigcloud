# Contributing to the Sovereign Community

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **OmniGCloud** and the **G-Framework**! By participating in this project, you are helping build the future of autonomous, sovereign multi-cloud engineering.

## The Scholarly Standard

This repository is part of a high-impact initiative recognizing **Extraordinary Ability** in Cloud Computing. We hold all contributions to a "Major Significance" standard of engineering excellence.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Propose an Architectural Pattern
If you have discovered a new sovereign design pattern (similar to our **Multi-Cloud Circuit Breaker** or **PALM**), please open an issue with the tag `pattern:proposal`.

### 2. Implementation & Code
- **Fork the Repository**: Work on your feature in a dedicated branch.
- **Strict Logic Separation**: Ensure all cloud-specific code is abstracted into the `/adapters` layer. 
- **Tests**: All logic-mesh code must include formal verification tests or state-convergence proofs.
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` before submitting.

### 3. Reporting a Bug
- Use the Bug Report template.
- Include the "Sovereign State Vector" or the specific infrastructure manifest where the drift occurred.
