MODE SELECTED: MODE 1 — EXECUTE APPROVED MOVEMENT & PUBLISH PLAN

Executing the approved plan from the previous analysis:
1.  **Public Repo**: Finalize removal of "Evidentiary Material" text from Research Footer to ensure public safety and neutral tone.
2.  **Private Repo**: Formally register S1 (`Automated Multilingual QA`) and S2 (`Distributed Systems Resilience`) into the Exhibit Index as "Scholarly Articles" now that they are confirmed public.
3.  **Commit**: Push changes to both repositories.
