      "content": "As global enterprise infrastructure shifts toward heterogeneous, multi-cloud architectures, traditional management paradigms are encountering a 'Scalability Ceiling' that results in significant operational fragility and strategic vulnerability. This paper introduces Autonomous Enterprise Control Plane (AECP), a pioneering architectural framework designed to decouple infrastructure governance from provider-specific execution planes. By implementing a closed-loop 'Sovereign Control Plane' driven by high-level intent mapping and automated reconciliation, AECP enables organizations to achieve absolute operational sovereignty. We present empirical evidence from large-scale deployments demonstrating a 31% reduction in cloud OpEx, a 94% reduction in Mean-Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), and a 99.7% automated compliance rate. This work represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous systems, offering a non-obvious solution to the industry-wide challenge of vendor lock-in and regulatory drift."

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "p1": "The global cloud market—valued at over $600 billion—is currently dominated by a handful of hyperscalers that utilize proprietary APIs and protocols to enforce systemic vendor lock-in. For the modern interconnected enterprise, this fragmentation creates a paradox: the adoption of multi-cloud strategies intended to increase resilience has instead introduced unprecedented levels of complexity, operational debt, and security risk.",
      "p2": "Autonomous Enterprise Control Plane (AECP) is proposed not as an incremental tool, but as a foundational architectural shift. It introduces a 'Neutral Intelligence Layer' that abstracts the underlying infrastructure complexity, allowing architects to define intent (e.g., 'Zero-Trust Security' or 'GDPR Residency') while the system handles the autonomous mapping and enforcement across AWS, Azure, GCP, and On-Premises environments.",
