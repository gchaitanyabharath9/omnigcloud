**Purpose:** Enforce global consistency across A1-A6, AECP, Scholarly Article

**Contents:**
- Terminology standardization (cell, Control Plane, Policy Engine)
- Numerical consistency (latency, throughput, availability)
- Conceptual hierarchy enforcement (A1 → A2-A5 → A6 → AECP)
- Cross-reference insertions
- Duplication elimination
- Global terminology glossary
- Automated consistency checks (grep commands)

**Use this to:** Eliminate contradictions and enforce consistency.

---

### 7. Phases 6-8: Final Hardening
**File:** `PUBLISHING-AUDIT-PHASE6-7-8-FINAL.md`

**Purpose:** Complete scholarly article alignment, AECP hardening, and final readiness

**Contents:**

**Phase 6: Scholarly Article Alignment**
- Abstract rewrite (problem-first, scholarly)
- Theoretical foundation section (2,500 words)
- Implementation detail removal
- Neutral tone adjustments

**Phase 7: AECP Hardening**
- 6 formal architectural invariants
- Positioning section (vs OPA, Zero Trust, Service Mesh)
- Unique contributions clarification

**Phase 8: Final Readiness**
- Per-document readiness verdicts
- Exact delta lists (what changed)
- Submission checklists (formatting, citations, figures)
- Venue-specific requirements
- Submission timeline (4-phase, 12-week plan)

**Use this to:** Complete final transformations and prepare for submission.

## Quick Start Guide

### If you have 5 minutes:
Read: `PUBLISHING-AUDIT-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`

### If you have 30 minutes:
Read: Executive Summary + Phase 1 (Classification) + Phase 2 (Gap Audit)

### If you have 2 hours:
Read all 6 documents in order (Executive Summary → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → ... → Phase 6-8)

### If you're ready to execute:
1. Start with Phase 2 (Gap Audit) to understand BLOCKER issues
2. Use Phase 3 (Structural Enhancement) for ready-to-insert text
3. Use Phase 4 (Claim Sanitization) for claim rewrites
4. Use Phase 5 (Cross-Paper Consistency) for global fixes
5. Use Phase 6-8 (Final Hardening) for final polish

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Fix BLOCKER Issues (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Add Related Work sections (use Phase 3 templates)
- [ ] Add Threats to Validity sections (use Phase 3 templates)
- [ ] Fix terminology inconsistencies (use Phase 5 global replace)

### Step 2: Fix MAJOR Issues (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Add formal problem statements (use Phase 2 examples)
- [ ] Strengthen evaluation methodology (use Phase 2 guidance)
- [ ] Sanitize over-generalized claims (use Phase 4 rewrites)

### Step 3: Apply Consistency & Polish (Week 5-8)
- [ ] Align numerical claims (use Phase 5 hierarchy)
- [ ] Add cross-references (use Phase 5 templates)
- [ ] Apply Scholarly Article transformations (use Phase 6)
- [ ] Apply AECP hardening (use Phase 7)

### Step 4: Final Preparation (Week 9-12)
- [ ] Convert to LaTeX/Word (use Phase 8 templates)
- [ ] Validate all checklists (use Phase 8 checklists)
- [ ] Submit to arXiv (establish priority)
- [ ] Submit to target venues (use Phase 1 targeting)
