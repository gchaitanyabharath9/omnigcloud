# 90-Day SEO + Lead Growth Roadmap: OmniGCloud

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to establishing OmniGCloud as the authoritative leader in sovereign cloud orchestration and converting high-intent enterprise traffic into qualified leads.

## Phase 1: Stabilize & Signal Authority (Days 1–30)
**Focus**: Technical SEO integrity, deep topical authority, and high-trust signals.

*   **Week 1: Indexing & Health Audit**
    *   Monitor Google Search Console for crawl errors or indexing delays.
    *   Ensure all new strategic playbooks are indexed by forcing re-crawls via Sitemap updates.
    *   Verify cross-locale canonical tags to prevent duplicate content penalties.
*   **Week 2: Content Deepening (Topical Authority)**
    *   Audit current landing pages (Platform, Solutions) for technical density.
    *   Embed "Technical Insights" and "FAQ" sections (already implemented) with high-value, long-tail keywords.
    *   Strengthen internal linking between the "Architecture Guide" and product feature pages.
*   **Week 3: Trust & Authority Signaling**
    *   Update the `Founder` and `Leadership` sections with deep, narrative-driven bios.
    *   Ensure compliance badges (SOC2, GDPR) are visible in high-intent conversion areas.
    *   Link to scholarly research (EB-1A evidence) from the main `Resources` hub.
*   **Week 4: Early Lead Capture Optimization**
    *   A/B test "Schedule Briefing" vs "Talk to an Architect" CTAs across different regions.
    *   Implement "Lead Intent" tracking (implemented via `analytics.ts`) to identify which pages drive the highest value engagement.

## Phase 2: Expand & Rank (Days 31–60)
**Focus**: Long-tail keyword dominance and broadening the funnel.

*   **Week 5-6: Strategic Content Expansion**
    *   Publish 4 new "Problem/Solution" blog posts focusing on regional compliance (e.g., "EU AI Act Compliance for Multi-Cloud").
    *   Develop 2 vertical-specific "modernization blueprints" for Financial Services and Healthcare.
*   **Week 7: Strengthening Internal Linking Map**
    *   Create a "Topic Cluster" architecture where the `Sovereignty Framework` acts as the pillar for all governance-related sub-topics.
    *   Ensure every technical article leads to a specific, context-relevant "Engage Us" path.
*   **Week 8: Performance Monitoring & Refinement**
    *   Analyze search impressions. Identify "striking distance" keywords (ranking 11-20) and optimize corresponding pages with deeper content.
    *   Adjust meta descriptions for pages with high impressions but low Click-Through Rate (CTR).

## Phase 3: Convert & Qualify (Days 61–90)
**Focus**: High-intent conversion and preparation for outbound & partnerships.

*   **Week 9-10: Decision-Stage Content**
    *   Create a "Cloud TCO Comparison Tool" (interactive calculator) to capture mid-funnel intent.
    *   Publish "Migration Decision Trees" to help architects self-qualify their environment.
*   **Week 11: Lead Scoring & Path Refinement**
    *   Identify "Investor-Signal" vs "Buyer-Signal" traffic based on engagement with the `Investors` narrative vs `Product` technical docs.
    *   Refine CTAs on highest-traffic pages to offer "Custom Strategy Sessions" for enterprise buyers.
*   **Week 12: Partnership & Ecosystem Readiness**
    *   Launch a "Partner Hub" for strategic consulting firms and GSIs.
    *   Audit the entire site for "Outbound Readiness" ensuring 1:1 alignment between sales outbound messaging and site landing pages.
