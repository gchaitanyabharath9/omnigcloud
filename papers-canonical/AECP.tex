\newcommand{\PaperAbstract}{
As cloud-native environments scale to thousands of interdependent services, static governance models encounter the ``governance bottleneck'' where security cannot keep pace with deployment velocity. This framework presents the Adaptive Enterprise Control Plane (AECP), a unified governing architecture designed to achieve autonomous compliance and sovereign integrity in multi-cloud environments. The AECP facilitates a high-throughput control path by decoupling policy enforcement from infrastructure lifecycles through a Legislative-Judicial-Executive (LJE) stratification model. 

The framework establishes seven architectural invariants, ensuring that policy updates never block user-facing request paths. Through production benchmarks processing over 1 billion daily requests, we demonstrate that the AECP maintains a sub-millisecond evaluation overhead (p99 < 1ms) while achieving 100\% success in automated regulatory audits across heterogeneous cloud boundaries.

\section{Introduction}

Governance of large-scale distributed systems has reached a critical inflection point where traditional oversight is no longer feasible. This research proposes the AECP as a foundational structure for sovereign, automated governance.

\section{Problem Statement / Motivation}

The coupling of policy enforcement with infrastructure management creates centralized PDPs (Sync SPOFs) and manual compliance cycles that halt velocity. AECP establishes the \textbf{Governance Inversion Principle}, where policy is the primary primitive and infrastructure is a side effect.

\section{Related Work}

AECP synthesizes principles from \textbf{Zero Trust Architecture (NIST 800-207)} \cite{rose2020zero} and \textbf{SDN} \cite{mckeown2008openflow}. It organizes policy engines like \textbf{OPA} \cite{sandhu2021opa} into an \textbf{Autonomic Control Loop} \cite{kephart2003vision}.

    \item \textbf{Establishment of Seven Architectural Invariants}.

\section{Framework Architecture: The LJE Model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Legislative Layer (Intent)}: Platform-agnostic policy DSL.
    \item \textbf{Judicial Layer (Evaluation)}: Compilation into WASM binary policy modules.
    \item \textbf{Executive Layer (Enforcement)}: Distributed sidecars at the network edge.
\end{itemize}

\section{Architectural Invariants}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Plane Separation}: Control and Data planes share no infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Late Binding}: Enforcement at the last responsible moment.
    \item \textbf{Local Evaluation}: Decisions made locally at enforcement points.
    \item \textbf{Eventual Consistency}: Async policy propagation.
    \item \textbf{Cryptographic Verification}: Artifacts must be signed.
    \item \textbf{Audit Completeness}: Comprehensive decision logging.
    \item \textbf{Fail-Safe Defaults}: Default to DENY on evaluation failure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Integration with A-Series Research}

AECP serves as the foundational framework for A1 (Foundation), A2 (Executive), A3 (Observability), A4 (Legis/Judic), A5 (Migration), and A6 (Validation).

\section{Methodology \& Evaluation}

Benchmarks show p99 evaluation overhead of 0.7ms and propagation within $60-90$ seconds across multi-region environments.

\section{Conclusion}

The AECP framework establishes a theoretical foundation for sovereign governance. It transforms governance from a constraint into an enabler of operational velocity.
