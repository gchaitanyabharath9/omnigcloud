# EXHIBIT E: KAZARIAN CRITERIA MAPPING (v2.0)
**Criterion:** Evidence of the alien's original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field. (8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(v))

## 1. Executive Summary of Contribution
The Applicant independently conceptualized, architected, and operationalized the **Deterministic Multilingual QA Framework**, a novel system-level architecture that replaces stochastic (random/unverified) localization processes with deterministic (mathematically guaranteed) software governance. This contribution addresses a persistent "Knowledge Gap" in the field: the inability to efficiently audit combinatorial surface areas in distributed web applications.

---

## 2. Evidence of Originality (Scientific/Scholarly)
The contribution is demonstrably original because it introduces novel methodologies not present in standard industry frameworks (e.g., Next.js, i18next).

| Element | Standard Industry Approach | Applicant's Original Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discovery** | Manual configuration of route lists. | **Recursive Route Inventory Engine:** Automated, dynamic traversal of the file system to map the entire application graph without human input. |
| **Validation** | Runtime fallback ("Graceful Failure"). | **Static Combinatorial Analysis:** Pre-compile time verification of the full $R \times L$ matrix (440 endpoints). |
| **Enforcement** | Warnings in logs (often ignored). | **Zero-Tolerance Release Gating:** A binary (Pass/Fail) blocking mechanism integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for Tier-1 markets. |

**Supporting Evidence:**
*   **Exhibit A:** Technical Research Paper (Section 3).
*   **Exhibit B:** Source Code excerpts (`route-inventory.ts`, `i18n-coverage.ts`) proving independent authorship.

---

## 3. Evidence of Major Significance (Impact)
The contribution has had a major significance on the field by demonstrably solving the "Scalability Limit" problem in international software delivery.

### 3.1 Overcoming the "Manual Limit"
For a standard enterprise application with 55 routes and 8 languages, manual verification requires auditing **440 endpoints** per release.
*   **Significance:** The Applicant's system automates 100% of this audit in < 3 minutes.
*   **Impact:** This transforms localization from a bottleneck into a scalable, automated operation, allowing organizations to expand into new markets without adding proportionate QA headcount.

### 3.2 Technical Determinism as a New Standard
By shifting the paradigm from "Best Effort" to "Deterministic Guarantee," the Applicant's framework establishes a higher standard for data integrity in regulated sectors (e.g., Finance, Government) where "silent regressions" (missing text) can lead to compliance violations.

**Supporting Evidence:**
*   **Exhibit C:** CI/CD Logs demonstrating the blockage of defective builds (Preventative Impact).
*   **Exhibit D:** Quantitative impact metrics showing reduction of "Silent Regressions" to zero.

## 4. Conclusion
The Applicant has not merely "configured" a website; they have engineered a novel **Quality Assurance System** that addresses a fundamental scalability problem in the field of Global Software Engineering. The originality is evidenced by the custom-designed architecture (Exhibit A), and the major significance is evidenced by the operational transformation and quantitative reliability guarantees (Exhibit D).
